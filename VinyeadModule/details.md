# Vineyard Module Creation

## 1. Set Up Roblox Studio Project
### 1.1 Create a New Roblox Project
- Open Roblox Studio.
- Click on "New" and select a baseplate template.
- Save the project with a meaningful name, such as "JuicyVineyardVentures".

### 1.2 Set Up Folder Structure
- In the Explorer window, create folders to organize your assets:
  - `Workspace/Vineyard`
  - `ReplicatedStorage/VineyardData`
  - `ServerScriptService/VineyardScripts`

### 1.3 Configure Game Settings
- Configure game settings such as lighting, camera, and player settings to suit the game environment.

## 2. Design Vineyard Plot
### 2.1 Create Basic Vineyard Plot
- Use the Terrain tool to create a flat piece of land for the vineyard.
- Add basic paths and placeholders for grapevines.

### 2.2 Add Terrain and Landscaping
- Add hills, trees, and other landscape features to make the vineyard look realistic.
- Use the Paint tool to add grass and soil textures.

### 2.3 Define Vineyard Boundaries
- Use parts to create fences or natural boundaries to define the vineyard area.
- Group the boundary parts and name them `VineyardBoundary`.

## 3. Implement Grape Varieties
### 3.1 Create Grape Models
- Create 3D models for different grape varieties using Parts and Meshes.
- Save these models in `ReplicatedStorage/VineyardData/GrapeModels`.

### 3.2 Define Grape Properties
- Create a ModuleScript in `ReplicatedStorage/VineyardData` named `GrapeProperties`.
- Define properties such as growth time, water requirements, and juice quality.

```lua
local GrapeProperties = {
    ["Concord"] = {
        GrowthTime = 3600, -- in seconds
        WaterRequirement = 10, -- in liters
        JuiceQuality = 8 -- out of 10
    },
    ["Chardonnay"] = {
        GrowthTime = 5400,
        WaterRequirement = 12,
        JuiceQuality = 9
    },
    -- Add more grape varieties as needed
}

return GrapeProperties

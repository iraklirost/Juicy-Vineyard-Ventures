1. Set Up Roblox Studio Project
1.1 Create a New Roblox Project
Open Roblox Studio.
Click on "New" and select a baseplate template.
Save the project with a meaningful name, such as "JuicyVineyardVentures".
1.2 Set Up Folder Structure
In the Explorer window, create folders to organize your assets:
Workspace/Vineyard
ReplicatedStorage/VineyardData
ServerScriptService/VineyardScripts
1.3 Configure Game Settings
Configure game settings such as lighting, camera, and player settings to suit the game environment.
2. Design Vineyard Plot
2.1 Create Basic Vineyard Plot
Use the Terrain tool to create a flat piece of land for the vineyard.
Add basic paths and placeholders for grapevines.
2.2 Add Terrain and Landscaping
Add hills, trees, and other landscape features to make the vineyard look realistic.
Use the Paint tool to add grass and soil textures.
2.3 Define Vineyard Boundaries
Use parts to create fences or natural boundaries to define the vineyard area.
Group the boundary parts and name them VineyardBoundary.
3. Implement Grape Varieties
3.1 Create Grape Models
Create 3D models for different grape varieties using Parts and Meshes.
Save these models in ReplicatedStorage/VineyardData/GrapeModels.
3.2 Define Grape Properties
Create a ModuleScript in ReplicatedStorage/VineyardData named GrapeProperties.
Define properties such as growth time, water requirements, and juice quality.

ReplicatedStorage/VineyardData/GrapeProperties.lua
local GrapeProperties = {
    ["Concord"] = {
        GrowthTime = 3600, -- in seconds
        WaterRequirement = 10, -- in liters
        JuiceQuality = 8 -- out of 10
3.3 Implement Grape Growth Stages
Create a Script in ServerScriptService/VineyardScripts named GrapeGrowth.
Implement logic to handle grape growth stages from planting to harvesting.

ServerScriptService/VineyardScripts/GrapeGrowth.lua
local GrapeProperties = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.VineyardData.GrapeProperties)

local function growGrapevine(vine, grapeType)
    local properties = GrapeProperties[grapeType]
    local growthTime = properties.GrowthTime
4. Develop Planting Mechanism
4.1 Create Planting Tool
Create a Tool in StarterPack named PlantingTool.
Add a LocalScript to handle player interactions.

StarterPack/PlantingTool/PlantingTool_LocalScript.lua
local tool = script.Parent
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local mouse = player:GetMouse()

tool.Activated:Connect(function()
4.2 Implement Planting Logic
Ensure the LocalScript communicates with the server to validate planting actions.
4.3 Handle Grape Variety Selection
Create a GUI for players to select grape varieties.
Update the player's SelectedGrapeType attribute based on their selection.
5. Expand Vineyard Functionality
5.1 Implement Vineyard Expansion Logic
Create scripts to manage the acquisition of new vineyard plots.
5.2 Add New Plot Acquisition
Implement a system where players can purchase additional plots of land.
5.3 Handle Plot Upgrades
Allow players to upgrade their plots with better soil, irrigation systems, etc.
6. Testing and Optimization
6.1 Conduct Unit Testing
Test each module and script individually to ensure they work as expected.
6.2 Optimize Performance
Optimize scripts and models to ensure the game runs smoothly.
6.3 Fix Bugs and Issues
Identify and fix any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
7. Documentation
7.1 Document Vineyard Module Code
Write comments and documentation for each script to explain their functionality.
7.2 Create User Guide for Vineyard Management
Develop a user guide to help players understand how to manage their vineyard.
7.3 Provide In-Game Help and Tutorials
Implement in-game tutorials to guide new players through the vineyard management process.
